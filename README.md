# Modeling data with probability distributions

Materials I developed for an intro to statistical modeling/simulations workshop

Was designed to be paired with reading of chapters 2 and 4 of "Probability for Enthusiastic beginners", which are freely available as [samples online](https://scholar.harvard.edu/david-morin/probability).

Some of the information in the slide deck and word document is geared specifically towards working with RNA-seq data, and with an extension of RNA-seq that the [Simon lab](https://simonlab.yale.edu/) at Yale developed called [TimeLapse-seq](https://www.nature.com/articles/nmeth.4582).
